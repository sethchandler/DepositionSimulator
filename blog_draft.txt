Today, I am excited to introduce a tool I have been developed: Seth Chandler's Deposition Simulator. This is a fully browser-based, AI-powered simulation tool designed to provide a safe, inexpensive, flexible, and endlessly repeatable environment for law students and new attorneys to hone their questioning skills. You can think of it as a flight simulator for depositions. It allows you to face a witness—complete with a detailed backstory, hidden motivations, and a specific recollection of events—and practice the art of asking questions, following up, and uncovering the truth. You can type in your questions or, to make it more realistic, speak them and have built-in speech recognition translate them to text. And, as is the case for most real-world depositions, there are documents associated with each scenario about which you can question the witness. You can choose the personalities of  opposing counsel and an optional judge. For complete flexibility, you can also change the rules under which the deposition is conducted, including making it more like a conventional trial governed by the Rules of Evidence. 
Here are some screenshots of the current web app beta. You can click on them and get to the live app.
What It Is, and How It Works
The app runs entirely in your web browser. It's what techies call a "client-side" application. This is a crucial design choice. In addition to making life simpler for the small development team here at legaled.ai, making the app client side enhances privacy., No information you enter—not your questions, not the AI's answers, and most importantly, not your API key—is ever sent to or stored on a server that I control. Your session is entirely private between you and your computer (and potentially the the AI provider you are using, depending on whether you have elected or paid for privacy there). Pedagogically, the goal is to provide a low-stakes, high-feedback environment. It’s a space to be awkward, to ask the wrong question, to follow a dead-end line of inquiry, and to learn from it without consequence. It might also be a place to have a little fun.
This design requires you to use your own API key, which connects the application directly to the large language model and to your credit card. While the phrase "API key" might cause some less technical readers of this blog to shut down (the same as when someone tells me, "Oh, just use a Docker container"), in fact you can think of an API key as being the equivalent of a password. The main difference is that service provider gives you a (very, very long) key; you don't pick it yourself. And while the phrase "connects to your credit card" might also strike fear, the practice depositions I am proposing are likely to cost less than a dime. Obtaining an API key just involves a few setup steps carefully described here.  For those concerned about runaway credit card bills, the cost estimator built into the app shows a running estimated tally of what the AI is charging you to process all those tokens.
Keep your API key private, the same as the password to your bank account!
Core Features: More Than Just a Chatbot
I have worked to build features that I believe make this a uniquely powerful pedagogical tool. It is not just about a simple question-and-answer exchange; it is about creating a rich learning experience.
Pre-Built Scenarios
To get you started immediately, the trainer comes with pre-built scenarios. So far there are five. The next version will likely add a few more. The initial release includes, for example, a "Domestic Violence Case: The Observant Neighbor," featuring a witness named Margaret 'Maggie' Ruth Chen. As you can see from the screenshots, Maggie is a 52-year-old retired teacher with a complex relationship to the events she witnessed. She has specific memories, a distinct personality, and potential credibility issues that a skilled attorney must navigate. These built-in cases allow a user to jump right in and start practicing without any setup. Two of the cases will likely resonate with those who have studied the law.
The Most Powerful Feature: Unlimited Customization
This is the aspect I am most proud of. And it shows how much you can use AI to help apps built with AI. While the pre-built scenarios are great for a quick start, the true power of the Deposition Trainer lies in its flexibility. Faculty or students can upload your own custom case files. There's extensive documentation on how to do this, including use of fun new tools such as "Agentic AI." 
What does this mean for you?
	•	For Law Students: You can take the fact pattern from your evidence or trial advocacy class, create witness profiles for each character, and practice deposing them. Imagine preparing for your mock trial final by running a full deposition of the key witness the night before. (Just be sure not to violate any licenses from vendors).
	•	For Professors: You can create a suite of custom witnesses for your students, each designed to teach a specific lesson about impeachment, refreshing recollection, or handling a hostile witness. You can create documents that support or impeach the witness.
	•	For Junior Associates: You can take the actual police reports, witness statements, and case summaries from a real file, anonymize them, and build a witness profile. This allows you to practice for an upcoming deposition on your actual case, exploring lines of questioning and anticipating difficult answers in a private setting. Just understand that this is a basic simulator and intended mostly a teaching tool. 
To make this accessible, I have included a detailed guide and a simple, powerful prompt in a readme file. You can give an AI a set of raw documents, links to news articles, or even just a simple sketch ("Create a witness who saw a car accident...") and ask it to generate a structured, psychologically realistic witness profile for you along with relevant documents. The instructions walk you through this process step-by-step, making a seemingly technical task surprisingly straightforward. One lovely feature of AI is that it is generally not fussy. You can be imprecise and it will figure things out.
The "Coach" Mode: Breaking Character for Strategic Advice
Every deposition has moments where you feel stuck. Is the witness being evasive, or did I ask a bad question? What am I missing? To address this, I built the "Coach Mode." 
With a simple toggle, you can switch from "Witness" to "Coach" before sending your message. In this mode, the AI breaks character. Instead of answering as Maggie Chen or whoever the witness may be, it provides meta-level strategic advice. You can ask things like:
	•	"What are this witness's biggest weaknesses I should be exploring?"
	•	"I feel like I'm not getting anywhere with this line of questioning. What's a better approach?"
	•	"Analyze my last three questions and tell me how I could have improved them."
This feature turns the simulation from a simple practice tool into an interactive tutorial, providing personalized feedback exactly when you need it. Again, the tool is not a perfect substitute for a trained professional. But try calling your human professor at 1 a.m.and see if you get a better response from them!
Other Key Features
	•	Judicial Oversight: You can enable a "Judge Mode" toggle. When active, an AI Judge will rule on objections, adding another layer of realism for practicing how you phrase questions to avoid them.
	•	Save Your Transcript: When your session is complete, you can save the entire deposition as a clean, formatted Markdown file. This is invaluable. You can review your own performance, see where you missed opportunities, or submit it to a professor or mentor for detailed feedback. Indeed, the intrepid AI user might want to provide an AI with a collection of transcripts and see what can be learned.
	•	Provider and Model Choice: The tool supports models from both OpenAI (like GPT-4o-mini) and Google (like Gemini 2.5 Flash), allowing you to choose the engine you prefer.
	•	Real-Time Cost Tracking: A live counter shows your token usage and estimated API cost, so you have complete transparency and never have to worry about a surprise bill.  Note the cost estimates are just estimates. Don't come running to me if the bill for your session is 9 cents instead of 7 cents.
	•	Local Mode: This app was designed mostly with legal education in mind. But, in fact, it is suitable for practitioners with real cases. The obstacle in such cases, however, is ethical obligations to one's client. This is not the place for an extensive discussion of American confidentiality rules, but one needs to be very careful before putting information relating to a client anywhere on the web. To address that, I have provided the hooks for "local mode" where the AI is hosted on your own machine using software called ollama. This alternative is not for the complete neophyte, but it also does not require a Ph.D. in computer science. There are detailed instructions on how to use and install ollama here. 
Acknowledging the Limits
While I am proud of this tool, it is important to be clear about what it is not. This is beta software. I am calling it version 0.9.  A deposition is a complex human event, rich with non-verbal cues, subtle shifts in tone, and the dynamic presence of opposing counsel—elements a 1000-line-of-code text-based simulation cannot fully capture.
The most significant limitation in this version is the focus on a single role: the attorney taking the deposition. The crucial, and often more difficult, role of the attorney defending the witness is not yet implemented. This involves a different skillset: listening intently, making strategic objections, and preparing the witness. Developing a robust "Defending Attorney Mode" is a primary goal for a future version 2.0. (Any of my subscribers want to help?). 
Also, the tool is a supplement, not a replacement, for real-world experience and mentorship. Its purpose is to make the transition into that real world smoother and more successful. It’s for the late nights when you want to run through a line of questioning just one more time. It’s for the student who wants to feel more confident before their first mock trial. It's for the junior associate who wants to be sharper and more prepared than the partner expects.
I Need Your Feedback
The future of this tool will be shaped by the people who use it. I sincerely hope you will give the Deposition Simulator a try. Explore the pre-built scenarios. Try creating and uploading your own witness. See what Coach has to say about your questions.
As you use it, please think about what could make it better.
	•	What other features would be most valuable to you? 
	•	Are the instructions for creating a JSON file clear?
	•	What kinds of pre-built scenarios would you like to see included?
	•	Are there any bugs or awkward interactions?
	•	Are there better prompts I could provide the AI so that its depictions of opposing counsel, the witness and the judge were more realistic.
For example, in earlier versions some of the witnesses just continued to perjure themselves. While of course this happens and while attorneys should learn how to deal with lying witnesses, at some point, given proper attorney questioning and foundation, most witnesses will break down. This project is an experiment in using accessible AI to solve a real problem in legal education. I look forward to hearing about your experiences and working together to improve it.

Notes
	1	I want to add a personal note about how this tool came to be, because it speaks to a profound shift in how we can create things. My full time job is as a law professor, not a software developer. My knowledge of Javascript, the language this application is written in, is minimal at best. A few years ago, the idea of me personally building an interactive, web-based application like this would have been completely absurd. It was an impossibility. The gap between the concept in my head and the hundreds of lines of code required to make it real was a chasm I could never cross.  This project exists for one reason: generative AI. I did not write this application in Javascript. I wrote it in English. I described the features I wanted, the layout I envisioned, and the logic the program should follow. Initially I used AI partners such as Gemini and ChatGPT to help me. These initial AI partners translated my instructions into functional code from which a basic app was used. To get to the final product, however, I used Claude Code, which is, to put it mildly, spectacular. When I encountered a problem I couldn't solve, I didn't search through programming forums; I described the problem in plain language. And, yes, it took a couple of iterations, and sometimes multiple AIs to get a fresh perspective. And it definitely took more than an afternoon. But ultimately, we succeeded.    The AI was also helpful in thinking about code architecture. "What is the most practical and economical way to deploy an app like this that ensures user privacy and avoids server costs for me?" The AI's suggestion—a fully client-side application that runs in the browser using the user's own API key—was the elegant solution that made the entire project feasible. And at the end, based on a query by me, the AI suggested a massive code refactoring project that – after some not inconsiderable transition pains – in fact did massively improve the software.  Now, I do not want to mislead. I do have a programming background. But it is really the ideas of programming and some vocabulary rather than the specifics of a particular language that come in handy in this sort of vibe coding enterprise. I needed an ability to tell the AI about how it would be useful to generate diagnostic methods to handle errors or to explain that scrollbars would be useful for longer depositions. I am not saying that someone who had never programmed anything before could generate an app as sophisticated as this one (or that someone more experienced in coding could not do far better). I am saying that the learning curve is now far less steep and the rewards far more visible.  If the app inspires legal professionals to consider additional ways in which AI and code can improve the practice of law, that itself would be a great outcome.
	2	Some of the models available in the simulator produce the highest quality outputs but they may prove too slow for many users and a little expensive. I would generally stay way from OpenAI's o3 model and from Gemini 2.5 Pro. Great models, but probably not for this application.
