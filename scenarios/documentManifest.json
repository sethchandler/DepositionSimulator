I felt extremely tired and pulled into the Starlight Motel parking lot to rest for a few minutes before continuing home.\n\nWhile sitting in my car, I heard shouting between two men near room 147. I saw one man, approximately 30 years old with dark hair and a scar over his left eye, stab another man with what appeared to be a knife. The incident lasted about 2-3 minutes.\n\nI was too shocked to intervene and drove home immediately. I called the tip line the next day because I felt it was my civic duty.\n\nI did not know either individual involved.\n\nWitness Signature: J. Sterling\nOfficer: Det. Maria Rodriguez #2847",

Sarah seemed terrified.\n\nNovember 3, 2007:\nWorst incident yet. From kitchen window I could see Jay hitting Sarah in the backyard. It went on for at least 15 minutes. I should have called police but I was scared he would see me. Feel terrible about this.\n\nNovember 15, 2007:\nJay's truck has been parked across the street every evening this week. He just sits there watching the house. Sarah's car hasn't moved in days. I'm worried about her.\n\nDecember 1, 2007:\nSaw Jay following Sarah's car when she left for work this morning. This has to stop. I'm documenting everything now in case it's needed later.\n\n[End of excerpts]",
