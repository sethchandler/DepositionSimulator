        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <span class="step-number">2</span>
        <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Pick a Case Scenario</h3>
            <p>Choose from several realistic legal scenarios, each with a different type of witness:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>John Sterling (Homicide):</strong> Eyewitness hiding an affair</li>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <span class="step-number">3</span>
        <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Start Questioning</h3>
            <p>Simply type your questions in the chat box and press Enter or click <span class="button-example">Send</span>. The AI witness will respond as a real person would, complete with evasions, emotions, and attempts to hide damaging information.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>📚 Understanding the Interface</h2>

    <h3>Main Chat Area</h3>
    <p>This is where your deposition happens. You'll see your questions and the witness's responses, just like a real deposition transcript. The AI will respond as the witness, while you play the role of the examining attorney.</p>

    <h3>Document Viewer</h3>
    <p>On the right side, you'll see any documents related to the case. These might include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email chains</li>
        <li>Phone records</li>
        <li>Hotel receipts</li>
        <li>Performance reviews</li>
        <li>Medical records</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip-box">
        <h3>💡 Pro Tip: Use Documents Strategically</h3>
        <p>Don't show the witness damaging documents immediately. First, get them to commit to their story, then use the documents to expose contradictions. This is the essence of effective impeachment.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Special Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Judge Mode:</strong> Toggle this on to have a judge present who can rule on objections</li>
        <li><strong>Out-of-Character Mode:</strong> Switch to this for coaching tips and strategy advice</li>
        <li><strong>Voice Input:</strong> Click the microphone to ask questions by speaking</li>
        <li><strong>Save Transcript:</strong> Download your deposition for later review</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🎯 Effective Questioning Techniques</h2>

    <h3>Start with Safe Territory</h3>
    <p>Begin with background questions that establish the witness's credentials and basic facts. This builds your foundation and helps the witness become comfortable (perhaps too comfortable).</p>

    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Good opening questions:</strong><br>
        "Please state your name for the record."<br>
        "What is your current occupation?"<br>
        "How long have you worked at TechCorp?"<br>
        "Can you describe your typical duties?"
    </div>

    <h3>Build Your Timeline</h3>
    <p>Establish a clear sequence of events. Get the witness to commit to specific dates, times, and locations. This creates a framework you can later challenge with documents.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Timeline building:</strong><br>
        "Where were you on the evening of March 23rd?"<br>
        "What time did you leave the office?"<br>
        "Did you go directly home?"<br>
        "Did you stop anywhere along the way?"
    </div>

    <h3>Use the Funnel Technique</h3>
    <p>Start broad, then narrow down to specific details. This prevents witnesses from wiggling out later by claiming they misunderstood the question.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Funnel sequence:</strong><br>
        "Did you have any communications that evening?" (broad)<br>
        "Did you make any phone calls?" (narrower)<br>
        "Did you call anyone between 11 PM and midnight?" (specific)<br>
        "Did you call Maria Martinez at 11:47 PM?" (pinpoint)
    </div>

    <h3>Lock in Their Story</h3>
    <p>Before impeaching with documents, make sure the witness is committed to their version of events. Use phrases like "Are you certain?" and "Is there anything you'd like to add?"</p>

    <h2>📄 Working with Documents</h2>

    <h3>Review Documents First</h3>
    <p>Before questioning begins, read all available documents. Look for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dates and times that contradict witness statements</li>
        <li>Communications the witness might deny</li>
        <li>Financial records showing motives</li>
        <li>Evidence of knowledge the witness claims not to have</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Art of Impeachment</h3>
    <p>When you find a contradiction between the witness's testimony and a document, follow this sequence:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Confront without the document first:</strong> "Are you certain you didn't call anyone that night?"</li>
        <li><strong>Give them a chance to correct:</strong> "Would it refresh your memory if I showed you phone records?"</li>
        <li><strong>Show the document:</strong> "I'm showing you Exhibit A, your phone records for March 23rd..."</li>
        <li><strong>Make the contradiction clear:</strong> "This shows a call to Maria Martinez at 11:47 PM, doesn't it?"</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Effective impeachment sequence:</strong><br>
        <strong>You:</strong> "You testified that you went straight home after work, correct?"<br>
        <strong>Witness:</strong> "Yes, that's right."<br>
        <strong>You:</strong> "You didn't stop anywhere?"<br>
        <strong>Witness:</strong> "No."<br>
        <strong>You:</strong> "I'm showing you what's been marked as Exhibit B, a hotel receipt from the Starlight Motel dated March 23rd. Do you see your name on this receipt?"<br>
        <strong>Witness:</strong> "I... well, I may have stopped briefly to rest..."
    </div>

    <h2>⚖️ Handling Objections and Difficult Situations</h2>

    <h3>When the Judge Gets Involved</h3>
    <p>If you've enabled Judge Mode, opposing counsel may object to your questions. Here's how to handle common objections:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Objection, leading!":</strong> Rephrase as an open-ended question</li>
        <li><strong>"Objection, relevance!":</strong> Explain how this relates to the case</li>
        <li><strong>"Objection, asked and answered!":</strong> Move on or explain why you need clarification</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Handling a relevance objection:</strong><br>
        <strong>Opposing Counsel:</strong> "Objection, Your Honor. The witness's personal relationships aren't relevant to this contract dispute."<br>
        <strong>You:</strong> "Your Honor, the witness's credibility is at issue. Evidence that he's lied about his personal relationships bears on whether this court should believe his testimony about the business relationship."
    </div>

    <h3>When Witnesses Become Evasive</h3>
    <p>AI witnesses are programmed to be realistic, which means they'll try to avoid damaging admissions. Here are techniques for dealing with evasive witnesses:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pin them down:</strong> "Please answer yes or no"</li>
        <li><strong>Repeat the question:</strong> "You haven't answered my question. Did you or didn't you?"</li>
        <li><strong>Use documents:</strong> Show them evidence that makes denial impossible</li>
        <li><strong>Ask the judge for help:</strong> "Your Honor, could you please instruct the witness to answer the question?"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When the Judge Seems Unfair</h3>
    <div class="warning-box">
        <h3>⚠️ Important: Is This Realistic or a Problem?</h3>
        <p>If the judge seems biased or makes questionable rulings, ask yourself: "Could this happen in real life?" Often, the answer is yes. Difficult judges are part of the legal landscape, and learning to handle them is valuable training.</p>
        
        <p><strong>When it's realistic training:</strong> The judge is gruff but makes legally sound rulings</p>
        <p><strong>When it might be a problem:</strong> The judge makes clearly illegal rulings or behaves in ways no real judge would</p>
        
        <p>If you think the AI is malfunctioning, try refreshing the page and starting over, or switch to a different AI provider.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>🔧 Troubleshooting Common Problems</h2>

    <h3>Technical Issues</h3>
    
    <div class="error-example">
        Error: "Failed to connect to API"
    </div>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Check your internet connection and verify your API key is entered correctly. Make sure you have credits remaining with your AI provider.</p>

    <div class="error-example">
        Error: "Document not found"
    </div>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Refresh the page and reload your scenario. If the problem persists, try a different scenario.</p>

    <div class="error-example">
        The witness isn't responding or gives very short answers
    </div>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Try asking more specific, open-ended questions. If the problem continues, switch to a different AI model or refresh the page.</p>

    <h3>Simulation Issues</h3>

    <p><strong>The witness admits everything too easily:</strong> Try a different scenario with a higher "perjury risk" witness, or ask more challenging questions that threaten their secrets.</p>

    <p><strong>The witness won't answer basic questions:</strong> The AI might be confused. Try rephrasing your question more clearly or start with simpler background questions.</p>

    <p><strong>Opposing counsel objects to everything:</strong> This might be realistic aggressive defense tactics. Argue your position or adjust your questioning style.</p>

    <h3>Getting Better Results</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Instead of "Tell me about that day," ask "What time did you arrive at the office on March 23rd?"</li>
        <li><strong>Use legal language:</strong> The AI responds better to proper deposition terminology</li>
        <li><strong>Stay in character:</strong> Address the witness directly, not the AI system</li>
        <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Building a strong deposition record takes time and careful questioning</li>
    </ul>
