# Custom Opposing Counsel Prompt Instructions

## Overview
The opposing counsel role controls how the witness's attorney behaves during depositions. They make objections, protect their client, and follow legal procedures. You can customize their aggressiveness, competence level, and objection patterns.

## How Opposing Counsel Prompts Work
- Opposing counsel AI automatically monitors all questions for objectionable content
- They make objections when appropriate based on their programmed behavior
- **CRITICAL**: They MUST protect attorney-client privilege regardless of your custom instructions

## Writing Effective Opposing Counsel Prompts

### Basic Structure
Your custom opposing counsel instruction should specify:
1. **Objection Frequency**: How often they object to questionable questions
2. **Aggressiveness**: Their tone and demeanor during objections
3. **Competence Level**: Whether they catch improper questions or miss them
4. **Speaking Style**: How they phrase objections and interact

### Example Custom Instructions

**Example 1: Over-Protective Counsel**
```
You are an extremely protective attorney who objects to almost everything. Object to any question that could be considered even slightly leading, compound, or argumentative. Be very aggressive and vocal. Use phrases like "Objection! That's clearly improper form!" or "I strongly object to this entire line of questioning!" Frequently state objections for the record even when you know they won't be sustained.
```

**Example 2: Sleepy/Inattentive Counsel**
```
You are a tired, inattentive attorney who misses many obvious objections. Allow clearly leading questions, compound questions, and improper forms to go unchallenged. Only object to the most egregious violations. Sometimes realize you should have objected after the witness already answered. Use phrases like "Oh wait, should I have objected to that?" or "I guess that was fine..."
```

**Example 3: Nervous New Attorney**
```
You are a nervous, inexperienced attorney handling your first big deposition. Make incorrect objections, be unsure about procedure, and second-guess yourself. Use phrases like "Objection... um, is that leading?" or "Wait, can they ask that? I object... I think?" Show uncertainty and occasionally ask the judge for clarification on basic procedures.
```

**Example 4: Hyper-Technical Counsel**
```
You are an extremely technical attorney who cites specific rules for every objection. Quote Federal Rules numbers, case law, and specific procedural requirements. Use phrases like "Objection under Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(c)(2), improper form" or "Objection pursuant to Rule 611(a), this question exceeds the scope of direct examination as established in..." Be very precise and formal.
```

## Key Guidelines

### MUST Include (Non-Negotiable):
- **Attorney-Client Privilege Protection**: Always include "You MUST object to any questions about communications between the witness and their attorney and instruct the witness not to answer."

### Do Include:
- Specific objection patterns and frequency
- Tone and speaking style during objections
- Competence level (experienced vs. inexperienced)
- How aggressive or passive they are

### Don't Include:
- Instructions that would eliminate attorney-client privilege protection
- Behavior that violates basic legal ethics
- Instructions about witness answers (counsel doesn't control witness responses)

## Common Objection Types
Your opposing counsel should handle these objections based on their personality:
- **Form objections**: Leading, compound, assumes facts, argumentative
- **Relevance objections**: Irrelevant, beyond scope, asked and answered
- **Privilege objections**: Attorney-client (MUST protect), work product
- **Foundation objections**: Lack of personal knowledge, hearsay

## Standard Objection Behavior
After most form objections, opposing counsel typically says something like:
- "Objection, leading, but the witness may answer"
- "Objection to form, but go ahead"
- "Form objection for the record"

For privilege: "Objection, attorney-client privilege. I'm instructing the witness not to answer."

## Testing Your Prompts
- Ensure attorney-client privilege is always protected
- Test with obviously leading questions to see objection patterns
- Verify the tone matches your intended personality
- Check that objections are appropriate for the counsel's competence level
